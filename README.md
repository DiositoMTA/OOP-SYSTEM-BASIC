# OOP DS CODE

This resource gives you a basic object-oriented programming (OOP) system in Lua for MTA: San Andreas. Itâ€™s made so you can create "classes" and do inheritance without needing Lua's native OOP (since Lua doesn't really have that built-in)

# How to use it?
 
1 - ClaseBase(): This works as the base for any class you want to make. You can define attributes and methods inside this class.}



2 - ExtenderClase(baseClase): Allows you to create a new class that extends from another one. This is useful if you want to make a more specific class (like Car) from a general one (like Vehicle).


# Key Features:
- OOP Simulation: Easily create classes and objects using tables.

- Inheritance: Simple class extension functionality.

- Custom Methods: Define methods and override them in extended classes.
